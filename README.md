  <h1>Infrastructure as Code</h1>

  <p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through code, rather than through manual processes. This allows for greater consistency, repeatability, and efficiency in infrastructure management.</p>

  <h2>Nextcloud Server Features</h2>

  <p>The Nextcloud server provides a wide range of features for secure file sharing and collaboration. Some of these features include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Self-hosted/on-premise deployment: You have full control over your data and where it is stored.</li>
    <li>File versioning: Keep track of changes to your files over time.</li>
    <li>Client-side encryption: Encrypt your files before they are uploaded to the server.</li>
    <li>Co-editing: Collaborate on documents in real-time with others.</li>
    <li>Inter-server sharing: Share files between different Nextcloud servers.</li>
    <li>File access control: Control who has access to your files and folders.</li>
    <li>Extensible storage: Use a variety of storage solutions, including local storage and cloud storage providers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Deploying Nextcloud Server using DevOps Technologies</h2>

  <p>To deploy Nextcloud Server using DevOps technologies, you can use the Ansible playbooks and roles provided in this repository. The playbooks and roles are designed to be modular and easily customizable, allowing you to adapt the deployment to your specific needs.</p>

  <p>The repository also contains instructions on how to deploy Portainer and WordPress on Docker containers, which can be used in conjunction with the Nextcloud server deployment.</p>

  <p>To clone this repository and get started with deploying Nextcloud server using DevOps technologies, use the following bash command:</p>

  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/cifer-sudo/Deploy-Nextcloud-on-Docker-using-Ansible.git</code></pre>

  <p>Note that this repository also includes instructions for deploying Portainer to manage your Docker containers and a WordPress container for hosting your website. By using this repository, you can deploy all three containers using DevOps technologies, helping you to save time and effort in your infrastructure management.</p>
